    //DAMON: Josh ur res is out on my screen at home the Extra  buttons on the menu are half on the the menu.
    //and after  i think the 5th round it cuts to an empty scene

    /*JOSH: the screen doesnt like it if you resize the window before playing i just fixed it cause it didnt like WebGL
     * and the 5th round was the shop its where you upgrade your weapons and player stats that hasnt been added yet
     * i fixed the first problem by making the canvas relative to a seprate camera that upscales instead as the animations didnt like rezising 
     * and as for the shop i set up a simple continue button with the ability to change pages as a base for you guys cause i was under the 
     * impression that you an noah where going to setup the shop
     * 
     * PS: the script you guys are going to be adding to is the shop manager script im going to add comments to it now to make it easier to navigate for you guys
